The aims of this project are:

- to make dialog systems that can be visualized as graphs. We
  currently use `graphviz <https://graphviz.org/>`_ for this.

- to make creation of dialogs accessible to students at a graduate or
  advanced undergraduate level.  Currently we use python for this and
  use notebooks as a way to explain the dialog creation process.

- to allow a hybrid of rule-based and machine-learned functionality
